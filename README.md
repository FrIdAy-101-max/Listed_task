# Voice Cloning with VITS
This repository contains the code and resources for a voice cloning project using the VITS (Variational Inference for Text-to-Speech) model. The project aims to clone a given voice and replicate it for a given text.

## Dataset

The training data for this project is based on the Ljspeech dataset. The Ljspeech dataset contains a collection of speech samples from a single speaker. Although relatively small, this dataset is sufficient to demonstrate the capabilities of the voice cloning system.

The Ljspeech dataset used for training is not included in this repository. Please refer to the Ljspeech dataset repository for more information on how to obtain it.

## Model Training

To train the VITS model, follow these steps:

1. Download the Ljspeech dataset and place it in the appropriate directory.
2. Preprocess the dataset to extract text and audio features required for training.
3. Configure the training parameters, such as the number of epochs, batch size, and learning rate, in the training script.
4. Start the training process using the provided script.
5. Monitor the training progress and evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.

Note: The details of the training process, including the architecture of the VITS model and specific hyperparameters, are available in the code files and documentation within this repository.

## Results
The  example_1.wav and eaxmple_2.wav  contains audio samples showcasing the voice cloning results. Each sample includes an original audio clip and the corresponding audio generated by the VITS model for a given text input.
Example 1 : "The examination and testimony of the experts enabled the Commission to conclude that five shots may have been fired"
Example 2 : "Many animals of even complex structure which live parasitically within others are wholly devoid of an alimentary cavity."
